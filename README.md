# README

A prototypical implementation of automatic decision-making with rules that operate on more data than a (one) DCC (and the ancillary `external` parameters intrinsic to the current DCC Validation Rules specification).

To run locally:

    $ npm install
    $ npm run dev

or:

    $ yarn
    $ yarn dev

Can be deployed through [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
